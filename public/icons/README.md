# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the PWA:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192px icon
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512px icon
- `icon-96.png` - 96x96px badge icon (optional)

## How to Generate Icons

You can use a PWA asset generator or create your own icons. The icons should feature a beer/beverage theme on a dark background with the accent color #4A9EFF.

### Quick Option: Use a Placeholder

For development, you can use any 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images temporarily.

### Professional Option: Use PWA Asset Generator

1. Visit: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload a square image (512x512 or larger)
3. Download the generated assets
4. Copy `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` to this directory

### Manual Creation

Create simple beer-themed icons with:
- Background: #141414 or #4A9EFF
- Icon: Beer glass or bottle silhouette
- Make sure they look good on both light and dark backgrounds
